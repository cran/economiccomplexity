# Basic trade example

## Package data

I'll use this demo dataset to illustrate the essential usage of the functions
within this package.

```{r}
library(economiccomplexity)
ec_trade_1962
```

## Revealed comparative Advantage (RCA)

You can obtain RCA with `ec_rca()`.

```{r}
r <- rca(ec_trade_1962)
r
```

Another possibility is to obtain RCA as a matrix or tibble without discretization.

```{r}
r2 <- rca(ec_trade_1962, discrete = F)
r2
```

## Complexity Measures

You can compute both Economic Complexity Index (ECI) and Product Complexity
Index (PCI) by using `ec_complexity_measures()`. The calculations methods are
*fitness* (default), *reflections* and *eigenvalues*. See [@atlas2014] and
[@measuringcomplexity2015] for the methodological details.

```{r}
c <- complexity(r)
c
```

## Proximity

Proximity matrices are used to create both country-country and product-product
networks. Using `proximity_matrices()` is straightforward.

```{r}
p <- proximity(r, c$diversity, c$ubiquity)
p
```

## Networks

The `proximity_networks()` function is designed to use `igraph` for the internal
computations and also to pass proximity-based networks to `igraph`, `ggraph`
or export to Cytoscape by saving the output as csv/tsv.

To create some reduced networks I'll use a high proximity cutoff, so that the networks are limited to the spanning trees for clarity and fast rendering.

```{r}
pr <- projections(p$proximity_c, p$proximity_p, 1, 1)
pr
```

Just two basic examples with `ggraph`.

```{r, fig.width=20, fig.height=12}
library(igraph)
library(ggraph)
library(magrittr)

set.seed(200100)

pr$projection_c %>%
  graph_from_data_frame(directed = F) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "kk") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = value, edge_width = value),
                 edge_colour = "#a8a8a8") +
  geom_node_point(color = "darkslategray4", size = 8) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), vjust = 2.2) +
  ggtitle("Country projection") +
  theme_void()
```

```{r, fig.width=20, fig.height=12}
pr$projection_p %>%
  graph_from_data_frame(directed = F) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "kk") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = value, edge_width = value),
                 edge_colour = "#a8a8a8") +
  geom_node_point(color = "darkslategray4", size = 4) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), vjust = 2.2) +
  ggtitle("Product projection") +
  theme_void()
```
